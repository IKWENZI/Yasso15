This project contains the Yasso07 soil carbon model and a user interface for it.

Yasso07 model describes cycling of organic carbon in soil. It calculates the stock of soil organic carbon, changes in the stock of soil organic carbon and heterotrophic soil respiration, and provides uncertainty estimates for the results.

Applications of Yasso07 include, for example, simulations of land use change,
ecosystem management, climate change, greenhouse gas inventories and education.

Yasso07 is a relatively simple soil organic carbon model requiring information only
on climate and soil carbon input to operate.

See the [Yasso homepage](http://www.environment.fi/syke/yasso) for more detailed information about the model, including a user manual for the program.

The user interface for Yasso07 is written in Python. You can download the provided executable for Windows or Linux in which case you don't need to have Python installed on your computer. If you do, you can also use the source distribution. See the InstallingYasso wiki-page for instructions on getting the dependencies for Yasso07 user interface installed.

See ChangeLog for the changes between the program releases.
